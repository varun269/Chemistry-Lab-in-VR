# Chemistry-Lab-in-VR
The Chemistry Lab in VR project simulates real-life chemical experiments in a safe, immersive virtual reality environment. Users can perform interactive tasks such as flame tests, titrations, and complex reactions like nitrogen triiodide synthesis, all enhanced through gamification and time-based challenges. Built using Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit, the application combines accurate chemical processes with intuitive VR controls to deliver an engaging educational experience. This project promotes experiential learning, allowing users to explore chemistry concepts through hands-on experimentation without real-world risks. It serves as a scalable, accessible, and innovative tool for science education.
